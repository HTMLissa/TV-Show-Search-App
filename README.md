A simple app to search for TV shows within the TVmaze API (http://api.tvmaze.com). 
The user can enter a TV show title into the input field and submit the form by clicking on the "Search" button. 
As a result, matching TV shows are going to be displayed as images along with the corresponding titles, release dates, and genres. 
The main goal was to practice working with WebAPIs & Axios. 
Eventually I'd like to add some styling to it via CSS.
